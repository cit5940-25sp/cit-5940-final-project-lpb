# â™Ÿ Othello: AI Strategy Game

A modern take on the classic strategy board game, powered by artificial intelligence.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project involved building a fully functional Othello game, integrating AI algorithms with a user-friendly JavaFX GUI. The core objective was to implement intelligent computer players using game theory algorithms and seamlessly connect them with the GUI for interactive gameplay.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

-   Java, JavaFX for GUI 
-   Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms for AI 
-   MVC design pattern (initially Strategy Pattern, but evolved)
-   CSS and FXML for enhanced GUI

---

## ðŸŽ® Key Features

-   Interactive UI with: 
  - Legal move hints; 
  - Time Remaining feature 
-   Clean visual design with a calming "deep green" color scheme 
-   Responsive board

## ðŸ¤– AI Strategy

The AI employs the **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate board states and select optimal moves. **Alpha-Beta pruning** is used to reduce computation and improve efficiency. The project also explored Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Custom (Randomized Negamax) algorithm.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ GUI Enhancements

The GUI was significantly enhanced using CSS for styling (colors, fonts, spacing) and FXML for layout. This allowed for a separation of UI design from game logic. A "Time Remaining" feature was added to increase the game's strategic depth.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Testing was conducted throughout the development process, including mocking the game and comparing it with online Othello games.
